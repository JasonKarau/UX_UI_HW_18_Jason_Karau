            <p>UX/UI Case Study</p>
            <img src="images/10kMobile.png" class="caseImg" alt="">

            <h2> Overview </h2>
            <p>
                Ten Thousand Books Is a Non-Profit organization that aims to add literature with diverse voices and experiences to school classrooms in Minnesota and Beyond. 
                They have a website thats fun looking and aimed towards kids but seems to be lacking in several usability areas. 
                I was able to work with a group and assess the tasks at hand.
            </p>

            <h2> The Problem </h2>
            <p>Ten Thousand Books is struggling to increase outreach to teachers and students. 
                Their presence on social media is acceptable, but without a clear central hub for more information on their organization, the user could lose interest on the way. 
                In terms of design, the current website features tacky colors and odd placements for links. 
                Fixing those small things could make a huge difference in building a better online experience for those interested, as well as making some needed additions. </p>

            <p>
                Our group brainstormed a scenario that would spark someone to seek out books focused on diversity, starting with a persona of a possible user.
            </p>

                <p>
                    Currently, Jackie is unable to find good materials to educate her students after a bullying incident. 
                    The students need to be taught about accepting others regardless of differences. 
                    How can she get clear information online to accomplish her goals? What type of interactions will she make once she finds that information online?
                    A Storyboard was created to portray the situation.
                </p>

                </div>
                <p>
                    If Jackie finds Ten Thousand Books, Our goal is to present Jackie with a bundle of resources that she could share with her students. Which the current website seems to not accomplish.

            <h1>Phase 2: Analysis</h1>
            <h2 style="margin-top: 20px;">Stakeholder Interview</h2>
                <p>
                    Our group was able to get in contact with a co-owner of Ten Thousand Books. There were some key takeaways that she wanted us to focus on keeping/adding. 
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Wanted to keep the same color palette
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Wanted to have a blog page
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Wanted to have (Increase) volunteer opportunities
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Is hoping to work with more schools and get more donations
                    </li>
                </ul>

            <h2 style="margin-top: 20px;">What Do Current Competitors Do?</h2>
            <p>Some current diveristy focused non-profits gave us an idea of how we can layout our page and potentially achieve what our stakeholder requests</p>

            <img class="myImages" id="myImg" src="images/10kimg/stex.png" alt="" width="auto" height="200">
                <div id="myModal" class="modal">
                    <span class="close">&times;</span>
                    <img class="modal-content" id="img01">
                    <div id="caption"></div>
                </div>

            <p>
                Something that WNDB does is have their outreach be the most imporatant part of their website within the hierarchy (see highlighted in orange). 
                The easier its able to be noticed, the better chance the user incentive is for getting involved or taking action. 
                Ten Thousand Books Isn’t completely clear on that.
                <br><br>
                Since Ten Thousand Books also wanted to show teachers and schools what they can receive when working with them, 
                providing immeadiate access to see a curated list of literature is likely needed.

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Navigation is working and shows active states for each main page. Although When a sub category is selected it still shows the main page as active, not the sub category.

                    <li>
                        Website seems to exhibit clear terminology
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        There is no use of icons to return or see what your interacting with, other than the active state of the page the user is on.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <li>
                    User control and freedom
                </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Main logo is easily accessible from every page and links back to home on click. Since there is little amounts of information on each page it's not a priority for a secondary control system to be present.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <li>
                    Consistency and standards   
                </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Each page matches it's intended destination. However, all body designs seem to never stay consistent. Pictures, text blocks, and buttons are not consistent across all pages.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <li>
                    Error prevention
                </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Only example of this sits on the contact page. If a user Misses filling out an email, the message wont send and will prompt user that the field must be filled out.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Another problem is that if a user only fills out the email field and presses send. The message will send and prompt the user with a "We will be in touch!" pop up. 
                        There should be a form of error prevention when a user does not fill out the name, phone, and message field as well.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                    <li>
                        Site is very informational and there is not any content that fits in the criteria of this standard

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Distracting colors and non consistent design is a common theme to this site. That shouldn't feel like the main issue but it defintly feels like it.
                        It's because the colors are not directly putting focus on UI elements. The website is simple. The colors should be simple as well and they do not match attention getting standards for the UI.

                    <li>

                </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Navigation is short and direct but it is missing other clickable features within the page that could be added to the top nav.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <li>
                    1.2 Margins
                </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Semi-passes accessibility (not comepletly accessible though) but color is an odd choice for margins.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <li>
                    1.3 Sub Navigation
                </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Seems out of place and could be added to the top navigation. For example, Donate is in 2 locations being displayed on the same page
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <li>
                    1.4 Card
                </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Having a card like this is fine. However, a suggestion would be to keep the colors consistent. Example being bright red on dark red.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <li>
                    1.5 Card Grid
                </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        This is an aspect that can be kept. Good use of space. This grid type could be used in the curated books section that we would plan to introduce.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <li>

                </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        This is an aspect that can be kept. Good use of space. However, section could be an option in the navigation.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <li>

                    <li>
                        A tad bit close together. No margins. Gets the point across though. The submit button text has no padding and seems large.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <li>

                    <li>
                        Good idea. However it moves slowly and UI for the carousel is visually bland/cant really see it.

                <p>
                    The Existing site doesn’t have a lot of content within the tabs and didn’t need to be seperated. 
                    Only additions or certain changes will help make the user experience more clear. As a group, the site map was easy to plan and create. 
                    <br><br>
                    I was able to create a User Flow with scenarios that were important processes. The three being the volunteer, donation, and contact processes.

                <p>
                    Adding a <b>Blog</b> was a client request. 
                    Ten Thousand Books would like to update users on what they are doing or talking about. 
                    This section would make users want to return, kind of like a news source.
                    <br><br>
                    Separating <b>“About Us”</b> from <b>“Our Work”</b> was a needed decision. 
                    The Existing site only shows what schools they work with, 
                    but no information on what they accomplished. 
                    Users being able to see accomplishments from the non-profit will give them incentive to possibly get involved.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Donate</b> and <b>Volunteer</b> were to moved to the top right next to the search bar. 
                    During research, we noticed that users were slow to go to donate when it was within the main nav. 
                    Separating it from the main nav and keeping it by a place where users go to search for information (like a search bar), gives it hierarchal  importance.
                     When building the Hi-Fi Prototype, It would be smart to give it a different button color.

                <p>
                    We kept the clients color choices in consideration. However, not all of them worked together. It was hard to make an educated usability decision.
                    <br><br>
                    The process of creating a moodboard helped us figure out a color combination to propose to the client and find existing sites to gain inspiration from.

            <p>
                We asked people to complete simple tasks while using the redesign prototype to see what patterns and opinions they provide
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Find information on the backstory of 10K books
                </li>
                <li>
                    Figure out what this non profit aims to accomplish
                </li>
                <li>
                    Find what books 10K books donates to schools
                </li>
                <li>
                    Donate to 10K books
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>Common Observations:</b></p>

            <ul style="margin-bottom: 0px;">
                <li>
                    Users tended to either find information on the non profit within the homepage or in the tab “About Us”.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The “Books” tab and content layout makes it seem like a recommended section instead of what 10K books would curate to schools. 
                </li>

            <h2 style="margin-top: 20px;">Where Do We (I) Go From Here?</h2>
            <p>
                Theres a lot on the to do list... We got plenty of great feedback from leaders and collegues. There is plenty I wish to accomplish as well. 
                <br><br>
                <b>Design:</b>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Re check accessibility for current color scheme (orange at smaller font sizes can be less accessible. Better on dark backgrounds. Could have 2 different versions of orange)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Lack of consitency in the style guide compared to the Re-design. Needs more elements that go hand in hand. These changes can be accomplished I get a grasp on a better color scheme and system made by myself, based on more research in that matter.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Make sure the site has consistent color blocks. Sometimes one page has floating elements while others are made in blocks.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2 style="margin-top: 20px;">What I Specialized In During This Project</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Lo-Fi prototyping (grid systems)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Trying to work with other differeing opinions and helping make a semi-consistent style guide (still needs work)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Hi-Fi designing, component creation, and navigation design
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2 style="margin-top: 20px;">What I need to work on:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>

                </li>
                <li>
                    Telling the story from the user perspective (Add on to what I already have)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Making sure we correctly present this to the stakeholder or client
