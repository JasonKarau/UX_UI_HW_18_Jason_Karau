            <p>UX/UI Case Study</p>
            <img src="images/tcmuDesktop.png" class="caseImg" alt="">

            <h2> Overview </h2>
            <p>
                TCMU Is a local Muscians Union that has been serving Twin Cities Musicians since 1987.
                They Advocate for for musicians’ rights in the workplace. Whether it is a nightclub, a symphony stage, a recording studio, or on tour.
                But what about this site is missing? What does it try to accomplish, but doesn't quite get there? 
                See how our group redesigned and provided value in a Union website.
            </p>

            <h2> The Problem </h2>
            <p>
                Twin Cities Musicians Union exclusively provides benefits for paying members, 
                effectively excluding any musicians who might consider joining their union but don't necessarily have the means to do so at the moment. 
                How might we expand our services so musicians who aren't members have support within the local community?
            </p>

            <h2> The Solution </h2>
            <p>
                We believe that adding community driven features that are accessible to anyone on the internet will create a support system for less established musicians, 
                increase traffic to the Twin Cities Musicians Union site, and result in more members for the union and closer ties with the local music scene.
            </p>

            <p>
                Our group brainstormed a Persona based off interviews (from muscicians) that would use the Twin Cities Muscians Union website.

                    <li>
                        Yes - Anything specific? How did you hear about them? Are you a member?

                </ul>

                <li>
                    Have you ever felt like you've been exploited while working in the music industry?
                </li>

                <li>
                    Did you attempt to follow up on a legal level?
                </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Yes - How did that turn out?

                    <li>
                        No - What stopped you from doing so?

                </ul>

                <li>
                    Have you ever had a negative experience performing when you felt unsupported by the venue or whoever hired you?
                </li>

                <li>
                    If you were to join a union, what do you think the primary benefit would be?
                </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>

            <p><b>Most Insightful Responses:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    I didn't have the resources or connections to follow up on taking legal action towards being exploited at a venue.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Wasn't paid for show (several similar responses)
                </li>
                <li>
                    General antagonism from venue mangers and staff
                </li>
                <li>
                    Joining a Union comes with heavy baggage. For example, paying to join and such. If I don't want to pay and still be involved?
                </li>
                <li>
                    Musicians must get paid for their work and treated like people rather than jukeboxes
                </li>
                <li>
                    It would be nice to Make sure certain venues that practice "bad business" don't get business.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Access to more opportunities, knowing the right people to email
                </li>
            </ul>

                <p>
                    There seemed to be a clear distinction of how people felt about their musician related problems not being heard and how there is no place to go to share them.
                    TCMU is currently only an informational site for Union members. <b>How can we make TCMU a central hub for everyone having problems in the music industry?</b>

            <p>
                We looked at other states musicians union's websites mainly from a place like California, where the music business is very saturated.
                It was interesting, they seemed to look way out of date. But they did things particularily well when it comes to hierarchy.
                Important buttons are at the top. And there organization of information was on point. Unfortunately, none of the sites featured a clear way for non members to get involved. 
                The Competitor analysis was more looking for heuristic ideas.

            <h2 style="margin-top: 20px;">Preparing the Narrative</h2>
                <p>
                    Why would our user go to TCMU and what would the scenario be? We prepared a UX scenario and a story board to get the message across from a usability perspective.

                <p>
                    We needed a way to increase non member traffic on TCMU. So, we made valuable additions. 
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Booking</b> is a way for interested venue managers to book an artist that is featured with TCMU. 
                    Venue managers that practice good business with muscians want musicians that practice good business with the venue. 
                    That is a relationship wish that our interviewees seemed to want. And increases traffic on the website for all sides.
                    <i>(The title of "Booking" was originally called "Live Music Marketplace". When doing Lo-Fi testing with users, 
                        they were confused that booking artists was related to that title. So thats why we changed it to Booking)</i>
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Report An Incident</b> would be a way for musicians to report venues harmful practices to TCMU. 
                    So members and non members can look out for places that wont be of value to them.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Around the Union</b> was originally its own news section. But that title expresses the aim to encapsulate all of the Unions news. 
                    All of the news and blogs are categorized and orginized under that section.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Members Green Room</b> was redesigned and re-orgainzed
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Login and Register Buttons</b> were added to the top of the page. They were orginally part of the main navigation and not higher in the hierarchy of the site.
